Problem 1A 

normalization(fname, attr, normType)
This function takes in the location of the data file, the attribute that has to be normalised (one of the values from 'Open','High','Low','Close','Volume') and the type of normalization to be performed('min_max' or 'z_score')
Based on the normalisation type that is mentioned, you will have to apply the appropriate formula and return a dictionary where key = original value in the dataset, value = normalised value
